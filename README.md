# Ng2 WebWorker Massic Table Demo
This is a demo of a massive table in Angular 2 that uses WebWorkers to keep the UI smooth.

# Run Demo
First clone the repo, run `npm install` and then run `npm run tsc`. This will compile the TypeScript files, and watch for changes.
In a seperate terminal window run `npm start`. This will start up a local webserver and open your browser to the demo page.

Note: due to a bug in the current alpha release of angular this project is installing a fork of angular from my repo as a dependency.
There's a [PR](https://github.com/angular/angular/pull/4840) out right now that will fix this soon.
